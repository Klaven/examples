# Kubernetes the Hardest Way

This section will house the files and scripts used in my "Kubernetes the hardest way" videos. these videos are based off of Kelsey Hightower's "Kubernetes the hard way" with the only major change being completed on KVM and not using google cloud infrastructure and tools.

### This section is incomplete right now!
I initially started the Kubernetes the hardest way as a way to teach some friends of mine about how kubernetes works and did not keep any of this information. I plan on doing the whole video set again with k8s 1.20 at that time this repository will be updated to containe the full set of updated instructions.
