# The Gen folder

When all of this is completed, during some aspects of these labs you will generate files. I have made it so that you can fork this repo and each time you gen files you can put them in the gen folder and pull this on each machine. In this regard all files will be on each machine. This should make "what machine has what files" much easier. If you pull your fork of the repo the commands should be 100% copy and pastable. though it is a learning experiance so I suggest you take your time! :)
